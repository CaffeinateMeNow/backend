Image from Pixabay, CC0. In the last few weeks, Greece has witnessed an increasingly turbulent
 political scene. Initially, a large part of the current political
events was due to the re-emerging national debate about the FYROM/Macedonia naming dispute; however,
 the latest turmoil has been triggered by a financial scandal involving
the pharmaceutical colossus Novartis and alleged bribes to political
officials. On 6 February 2018, Parliament received allegations against the
pharmaceutical company which were made by anonymous witnesses in the
case. According to the earliest known facts, there are indications of
“bribes” which tallied up to 50 million euros and involved 10
high-ranking political figures from the previous Greek administration in
 a total of more than 30 people, including former general secretaries,
political counselors and former directors of government agencies. The
loss for the Greek state is estimated to exceed 3 billion euros for the period between 2000-2015. Τhe scandal has already been dubbed a “ megaton bomb “. Minister of Justice Stavros Kontonis has called it “the biggest scandal since the creation of the modern Greek state “, even surpassing the Siemens Case, a corruption and bribery scandal regarding
security systems and the purchase of state contracts in the 1990s. Novartis and the current investigation Novartis Building in Basel, Switzerland. Wikimedia Commons, CC BY 2.0 Novartis, a multinational healthcare company based in Switzerland, is
 at the epicenter of a global investigation about alleged illegal
payments to state officials which led to unfair competition practices
and established its leading position in the global market. Since 2014, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI have been investigating and discovering numerous company malpractices — allegedly applied in Greece as well. These malpractices include
bribes to politicians, state officials associated with the Ministry of
Health, doctors and hospital staff. Doctors would allegedly promote and
prescribe Novartis’ products which would sometimes cost much more than
their competition. As pointed out in several media outlets over the last few days: Translation Original Quote Greece
 is a country of special interest for Novartis; the price of a product
in Greece would influence its price worldwide. An increase of 10 cents
in Greece would bring a 25 million profit for the company. […]
 η Ελλάδα είναι χώρα ειδικού ενδιαφέροντος για την Novartis, αφού η τιμή
 ενός προϊόντος στην Ελλάδα, θα επηρέαζε την τιμή του διεθνώς. Έτσι, μια
 αύξηση 10 σεντ στην Ελλάδα, υπολογίζεται ότι μπορεί να μεταφράζεται σε
κέρδη 25 εκατομμυρίων για την εταιρεία. Novartis had played a crucial role in promoting ophthalmologic and
oncological drugs for cancer patients as well as high numbers of
vaccines against the H1N1 flu virus with significant financial gain for
the company. As indicated in a 2009 article by news portal Euro2Day: Translation Original Quote The stock of the company is currently recording a 3.16% rise. Η μετοχή της εταιρίας καταγράφει αυτήν την ώρα άνοδο της τάξης του 3,16%. Twitter user NikosBovolos now sarcastically wonders: Ποιος να φανταζόταν ότι θα είχαμε κάποτε σκάνδαλα
 στην υγεία τότε που ο Αβραμόπουλος παράγγελνε 16 εκατομμύρια εμβόλια
για μια χώρα 10 εκατομμυρίων ανθρώπων; #Novartis — Ο Νίκος ο Μπόβολος (@NikosBovolos) 6 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 Who could imagine that we would see
scandals in the Health sector, when [ex-Ministry of Health and now
accused] Mr. Avramopoulos ordered 16 million vaccines for a country with
 a population of 10 million? Reactions from the Greek political scene After news of this latest scandal hit the press, social media outlets
 started getting flooded with reactions, comments and memes by netizens
under the hashtags #novartis or #Novartis_gate. There
 have also been reactions offline in response to the allegations by the
accused prominent political figures themselves. Among the first questions raised about the credibility of this latest news was the convenient timing of its revelation. The
 anonymous protected witness testimonies were given last November and
the last one was given on February 4th, at the peak of the
“Macedonia/FYROM talks”. The news about the scandal gained more traction
 around the same time a massive rally took place in Athens which
protested the use of the term “Macedonia” as an official state name by
neighboring FYROM. As the current scandal takes over headlines, some
feel that this might be a tactic to distract from this pressing
political issue affecting the current administration: Για να δείτε πόσο εύκολα αλλάζει η ατζέντα και τα πρωτοσέλιδα και πάει περίπατο το συλλαλητήριο #Novartis — Dimitris Ikonomou (@dimoikonomu) 5 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 See how easily agenda and headlines are shifted and the rally just fades out Μια #Novartis την ημέρα την #Μακεδονια κάνει πέρα — peristeraRa (@peristeraRa) 6 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 A “Novartis” [case] a day keeps “Macedonia” [case] away 100 #Novartis να βγαλετε # syriza_xeftiles Η Μακεδονια ειναι ΜΙΑ κ ελληνικη pic.twitter.com/VJupavmo0t — kgogon (R) (@kgogon) 7 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 Even if you reveal 100 Novartis [cases], Macedonia is ONE and is Greek In addition, a crucial issue for the Prosecutor of the Corruption
Bureau is preserving the anonymity of the protected witnesses — two men
and a woman — since they have allegedly expressed fear for their own
lives. And not unreasonably. One of the accused Greek politicians, Evangelos Venizelos, former
Deputy Prime Minister and current Minister in various departments for
the PASOK party, asked for the witnesses’ protection to be canceled so that anyone can sue them for slander or perjury. Later, he made comments which many felt threatened the witnesses . Ευάγγελος Βενιζέλος για τους μάρτυρες στο σκάνδαλο Novartis: “…νομίζουν οι δύστυχοι ότι θα είναι εσαεί προστατευμένοι”. Ίσως η χυδαιότερη φράση που ειπώθηκε από πολιτικό τον 21ο αιώνα, κι ο ανταγωνισμός μόνο ευκαταφρόνητος δεν είναι… — Elikas (@Elikas) February 8, 2018 Evangelos Venizelos for the Novartis scandal witnesses: “…poor people, they believe they will be protected forever”. Maybe the vilest phrase said by a politician at the 21st century. And the competition is rather not insignificant… Marios Salmas, the former Deputy Minister of Health for the New
Democracy party, also accused of receiving illegal payments by Novartis,
 appeared live in a TV broadcast and also threatened to punish the
case's protected witnesses. According to the feature video in an article by the Tribune news portal , he insists: Translation Original Quote I
 only say one thing. Those witnesses that testified here — even if they
got new identities — will be found and will be punished. Greece is a
small country. […]Σας
 λέω ένα πράγμα οι μάρτυρες αυτοί που κατέθεσαν εδώ –ας τους άλλαξαν
ταυτότητα- θα βρεθούν και θα τιμωρηθούν. Είναι μικρή η Ελλάδα. Twitter user @Kyria_Katy acutely mourned: Ζω στη Χώρα, που σε ζωντανή τηλεοπτική εκπομπή, με περίσσιο θράσος, πρώην Υφυπουργός Υγείας, απειλεί προστατευόμενους μάρτυρες. #Novartis_gate #Novartis — Pyrgodespoina (@Kyria_Katy) 6 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 I live in the Country, where an ex Minister of Health of remarkable nerve threatens protected witnesses in a live TV broadcast. And user @Paralogistis exclaimed: Ελλάδα η μοναδική χώρα στον πλανήτη όπου δικάζονται οι μάρτυρες pic.twitter.com/A6N3rTmE9X — paralogistis (@paralogistis1) 7 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 Greece, the only country in the planet where the ones judged are the witnesses. [The image reads]: Novartis Scandal. Ev. Venizelos: Do the witnesses think they will be forever protected? M. Salmas: The protected witnesses will be found and punished! A public debate has also been initiated regarding whether or not the
allegations made in the testimonies have any base or are simply an
attempt to tarnish prominent political figures from both the opposition
ex-ruling parties of PASOK and New Democracy, as German business newspaper Handelsblatt notes. The ten prominent politicians, two ex-Prime Ministers and eight
ex-Ministers alleged to be involved in the scandal, have denounced the
accusations against them. Some of them even threatened to react with
lawsuits, calling the case “political targeting” and “bullying”. Ex-Prime Minister Antonis Samaras declared that he
 will press charges against Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and against
Dimitris Papaggelopoulos, ex-Director General of the National
Intelligence Service and current Minister of Justice. Another accused MP, Adonis Georgiadis, ex-Minister of Health for the
New Democracy party, known for his controversial statements, expressed
his belief that the whole scandal is “set and directed” by the Alternate Minister of Health Pavlos Polakis, who was implied to be an FBI agent . Mr. Polakis himself answered via his Facebook page with a hilarious meme he had received from netizens: Adonis, you are right!!!! I even received my ID card !!!! Haha, I just died laughing, I was sent this not long ago!!! The main argument against the accusations of this case is that the
alleged perpetrators claim they cannot be brought to justice due to a
statute of limitations. Πόσο θράσος πρέπει να έχεις για να τουητάρεις είδηση που λέει ότι αδικήματα του σκανδάλου #Novartis – που αφορούν περίοδο στην οποία ήσουν υπουργός – έχουν παραγραφεί ! #Novartis_gate κ ποιός είχε τσίπα κ την έχασε ! pic.twitter.com/v1dtjAst1I — Μανόλης della Creta (@baxebanis) 5 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 How much nerve you must have, when
you tweet a news story saying that the Novartis scandal offenses – taken
 place during your term as a Minister – have been time-barred! As if he
even had honor and lost it! Είναι δυνατόν η επίσημη θέση της #ΝΔ στο #Novartis_gate να επικεντρώνεται στην τυχόν παραγραφή κάποιων από τα αδικήματα; Σοβαρά τώρα; #Novartis — Κapoios Αllos (@Kapoiosmpla) 6 Φεβρουαρίου 2018 Is it possible that the official
argumental line of New Democracy party about #Novartis_Gate focuses at
the possibility of time-barred offenses? Seriously now? This scandal is unfolding slowly and has been shaking the whole Greek
 political and social scene. However, there are doubts about whether or
not any real results will come of the case, as many feel that Greece has
 a bad history of bringing “real” justice to similar cases. Let's see
what the repercussions will be in the following days and months.
